  'Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot~',
  'Crash Bandi-bandicoot!',
  'He jumps to do a spin attack',
  'In an abandoned place, yes yes yes',
  'Out and collecting apples for dinner',
  'He始s not scared even if it始s shaking, rumbling',
  'Crash has been everywhere!',
  'Dashing around in his jeans, always feels good, bye bye bye!',
  'Wouldn始t everybody like to go on a vacation?',
  'This place looks nice, right?',
  'Yeah, he始s sneaking around everywhere',
  'Is it okay to be doing that here?',
  'Uuh everybody break out before a terrible surprise makes you jump'
